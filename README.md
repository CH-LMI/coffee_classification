# Python with Java 

At first, we wanted to sort through wine data to create a model that could essentially do some of the work of sommeliers. After not finding data with which we were satisfied, we thought about looking into whiskey or beer. Still, we weren't satisfied. We quickly realized that coffee culture has been picking up, and as coffee aficionados, we realized this would be the perfect topic. Thanks to James LeDoux (https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database), we found a plethora of data regarding coffee quality scores and various features, most of which was sourced from the Coffee Quality Institute (https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/coffees/arabica). We also sourced price data from the International Coffee Organization (http://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp).
